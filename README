This folder contains the source code of the solution for Doublebeam programming exercise by Alexander Sergeev (me@alxsrg.com)
HOW TO BUILD
You need a C compiler to build this stuff.
I use Mac OS X with gcc (and Xcode).
On your system, the build process may differs.
Mac OS X or Linux:
$ gcc AlxSrgDoublebeamSrc/AlxSrgDoublebeam/main.c -o AlxSrgDoublebeam
Mac OS X (XCode)
Load AlxSrgDoublebeamSrc/AlxSrgDoublebeam.xcodeproj into Xcode and hit the "Build" button
Windows
I don't know. The code is located in AlxSrgDoublebeamSrc/AlxSrgDoublebeam/ main.c
USAGE
This is a console application; it accepts two arguments - string1 and string2
$ ./AlxSrgDoublebeam string1 string 2
for example,
$ ./AlxSrgDoublebeam abc abc aabbcc
$ ./AlxSrgDoublebeam abc def cba
fed
$ ./AlxSrgDoublebeam def abc cfbead
SOURCE CODE
The code is located in AlxSrgDoublebeamSrc/AlxSrgDoublebeam/main.c
My version of MyStrCmp takes const char* instead of char* because we do not need to change the string content here.
The source code includes some tests, but they are commented out.
I wrote them for my own purposes. Yes, they include strcmp function call in order to check the correctness of my own MyStrCmp version.
